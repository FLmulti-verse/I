Wearable Device for Memory Support and Mental Health Aid
Abstract
The proposed wearable device aims to assist individuals dealing with memory loss and mental health challenges. By integrating Multimodal AI (M.AI.E), the device will process environmental cues, store relevant information, and provide reminders. This white paper outlines the concept, technology, and potential impact of the device.

Introduction
Memory loss and mental health issues significantly impact the quality of life for affected individuals. Our wearable device seeks to address these challenges by leveraging advanced technology. The device will serve as a companion, providing personalized support and enhancing safety.

Background
Existing solutions often fall short in meeting the diverse needs of individuals with memory loss or mental health conditions. Wearable technology has evolved rapidly, making it feasible to create a device that combines AI capabilities with real-time data collection.

Objectives
Action Reminders: The device will remind users of important tasks, appointments, and goals.
Identity Reinforcement: It will reinforce self-identity by providing context about the userâ€™s surroundings, relationships, and personal history.
Safety Monitoring: The device will detect potential hazards (e.g., leaving the stove on) and alert the user.
Technology Overview
Multimodal AI Integration (M.AI.E)
The device will process data from various modalities, including:
Visual: Capturing images of the environment.
Audio: Recording conversations and ambient sounds.
Text: Analyzing written information (e.g., notes, labels).
M.AI.E algorithms will extract relevant patterns and context.
Data privacy and security measures will be implemented.
Sensors and Data Collection
Camera: Captures visual information.
Microphone: Records audio cues.
Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Detects movement and orientation.
GPS: Provides location data.
Design Considerations
Ergonomics: The wearable should be comfortable for long-term use.
User Interface: Intuitive controls for interaction.
Aesthetics: A discreet design to reduce stigma.
Compliance: Adherence to safety and health regulations.
